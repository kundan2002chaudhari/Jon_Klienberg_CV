                <p>I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles
                    they play in
                    large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has
                    been supported
                    by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a
                    Packard Foundation
                    Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty
                    Fellowship, and
                    grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member
                    of the
                    National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts

    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In 2021 and 2022, Karen Levy and I taught a new course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO
            1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a
            range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>

            <li><em>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like
                    the
                    course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support
                    deeper
                    explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</em></li>
